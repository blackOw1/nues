Nues - News at your fingertips. Simplified.

Nues uses the NewsCatcher News API to deliver content from various sources. The API is free to use and was the best choice for this project. Though, the API is limited, so I have implemented code to only refresh the content every 30 minutes to reduce the number of calls to the API. The content will refresh on page load.
